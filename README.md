# Disaster-Relief-Project

Using satellites, UAV’s, and data analysis in conjunction significantly shortens search and rescue time (from days to hrs) in natural disasters. 

1. Used Satellite picture analysis with a convolutional neural network implemented from scratch using PyTorch to significantly reduce search and rescue time in natural disaster response by deploying UAV’s to target areas affected by disasters based off of my algorithm. 

2. Simulated results using a systems engineering software called Systems Tool Kit (STK).
